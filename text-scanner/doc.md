# Usage

This is a simple OCR implementation that helps you detect and list images with text in them.

You can then say `y` and that will delete the images

Run the script in terminal, pass the folder to your images to scan, press enter.

Let it run, wait for the list to be produced, and check the image (if you want)

Then, either say `y` or `n` to delete them all or not.
