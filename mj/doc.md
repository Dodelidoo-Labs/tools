# Usage

You need a CSV file with two columns:

- first column is the prompt
- second column is the URL to the image

Then run `cleanmjprompts.py` script in the terminal, pass your CSV file and run it.

It will clean the MJ Prompts automatically and make them SD ready in a new CSV file

Then, run `downloadmjimgs.py` to download the images and generate txt files with the prompts that we just cleaned above.
